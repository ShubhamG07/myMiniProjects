So it's a Student Registration Portal in which user can enter his details and it will show in table below. He can then either edit or delete that also from table. It's made with javascript with the help of localStorage so even after refreshing the page it will still show records in table fetching it from localStorage. There is also system that will prevent user to enter repeated entries for same student id, email id or mobile number . Also user cannot leave any input empty. And name can only contain letters and space, Mobile can contain only numbers with minimum length 10 digits. Student id can only be numeric.
